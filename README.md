# EECS6895
This is the course project for task A5, object tracking and prediction.
Things we've done here include:
1. Built both location classifier and scale classifier.
2. Built parallel pipeline for multiple targets tracking.
3. Conducted test on overlap targets tracking.
4. Combined Appearance-based tracking with Kalman filter.
5. Added a work-around approach for handling occlusions.
6. Calculated and predicted the motion and position when occlusion is assumed.
